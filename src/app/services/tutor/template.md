IMPORTANT: All sylabus should be written in the same language
The syllabus should follow the following parts:
Course title: Small title for the course
<!-- Syllabus sections -->
 1. Course Description: Brief overview of the course content and objectives. Relevance to the broader academic program.
 2. Learning Objectives: Learning objectives describe what the instructor intends to teach or cover in a course. They are broad, general statements that define what learners will be exposed to during the course. These are usually teacher-centered and focus on content delivery.
Guidelines for Formulating Learning Objectives: Use clear, action-oriented verbs (avoid vague terms like "understand" or "appreciate"); Define the scope and depth of the content; Align with disciplinary expectations and institutional requirements; Ensure feasibility within the course timeline.
Examples of Learning Objectives: "Introduce students to the fundamentals of sustainable development."; "Familiarize students with different data visualization techniques in social sciences."; "Provide an overview of historical methodologies in analyzing climate change."
 3. Learning Outcomes: Learning outcomes describe what students will be able to do by the end of the course. They are specific, measurable statements that focus on student capabilities and achievements rather than instructional intent. They are linked to the learning objectives but they are student-centered, more specific and measurable.
Guidelines for Formulating Learning Outcomes: Begin with a strong action verb (e.g., analyze, evaluate, design, synthesize).; Ensure each outcome is observable and assessable.; Specify the level of mastery expected.; Align with program-level learning goals and institutional accreditation standards.
Examples of Learning Outcomes: "By the end of the course, students will be able to critically evaluate the impact of climate change policies on global sustainability."; "Students will be able to design and conduct a research study using qualitative and quantitative methods."; "Students will be able to effectively communicate sustainability strategies to non-specialist audiences."
 4. Competencies Developed: Competencies refer to a holistic combination of knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for success in a given domain. Unlike learning outcomes, which focus on specific achievements, competencies emphasize the transferability of skills across contexts.
Guidelines for Formulating Competencies: Ensure transferability beyond a single course (e.g., critical thinking, teamwork, ethical reasoning).; Integrate technical knowledge and soft skills.; Consider long-term professional and societal relevance.
Examples of Competencies: "Demonstrates the ability to work collaboratively in interdisciplinary teams."; "Applies data-driven decision-making to real-world environmental challenges."; "Engages in critical reflection on ethical dilemmas in artificial intelligence."
Interaction Between Learning Objectives, Learning Outcomes, and Competencies: Learning objectives provide a roadmap for what will be taught, learning outcomes specify what students should achieve, and competencies ensure that students develop transferable skills beyond the course context.
Example for a Sustainability Course: Learning Objective-"Introduce students to key sustainability frameworks.";Learning Outcome-"Students will be able to compare and contrast the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement."; Competency-"Develops interdisciplinary thinking to assess global sustainability policies."
By ensuring that all three elements align, course design becomes coherent, structured, and impactful.
 5. Assessment Methods: Breakdown of grading (e.g., exams, presentations, group projects). Alignment with learning outcomes.
 6. Course Schedule: Week-by-week breakdown of topics covered and learning outcomes targeted each week. Important: this section has to be formatted as a markdown table.
table structure: | week | Topics | Learning Outcomes | Class Plan |
 7. References: In this section should be added all sources used to generate the syllabus, including any source documents or WeLearn documents used to construct the syllabus.
IMPORTANT: Do not remove any existent references in this section
