A pedagogical framework to guide university teachers in incorporating climate change and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into their classes should focus on several key areas, including learning objectives, content integration, pedagogical approaches, and teacher training. The aim is to ensure all students gain a common understanding of these issues and are empowered to make informed decisions and take action.

### Core Principles
*   **Interdisciplinarity and Transdisciplinarity:** The framework should encourage the breakdown of traditional disciplinary silos to foster a systemic understanding of ecological issues. This involves connecting knowledge across disciplines and integrating various forms of knowledge and practices.
*   **Holistic Education:** A "head-heart-body" approach should be adopted, which integrates cognitive, emotional, and practical dimensions of learning. This entails going beyond the mere transfer of knowledge and aiming for a deeper understanding that engages students on multiple levels.
*   **Learner-Centered Approach:**  The pedagogy should focus on learners as autonomous individuals who actively construct their own knowledge. This requires stimulating learners' prior knowledge and experiences, and encouraging them to reflect on their learning processes.
*   **Real-World Application**: Learning should be linked to real-world contexts to enhance student motivation and give meaning to reflections on the future. This includes cooperation with external partners, project-based collaborations, and addressing real societal challenges.
*   **Transformative Learning**: The framework should promote critical thinking and challenge existing assumptions to foster a shift in both consciousness and behavior. It needs to trigger a deep reflection about the students' relationship with the world.

### Learning Objectives
*   **Specific Learning Objectives for SDGs:** Educators must set specific learning objectives for the different SDGs, while ensuring these objectives are not isolated from the key sustainability competencies.
*   **Competency Development:** The framework must develop key competencies, such as systems thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving, and advocacy. These competencies are essential for dealing with various sustainability challenges and connecting the SDGs.
*   **Ethical Discernment:** Courses should provide spaces for learning ethical discernment by exploring individual and collective dilemmas, and understanding different schools of thought and ethical approaches.
*   **Life-Long Learning:** Students should be equipped to use all opportunities for their own education throughout their lives, applying their acquired knowledge to promote sustainable development in everyday situations.

### Content Integration
*   **Curriculum Mainstreaming**: Sustainability topics should be integrated into existing curricula and not treated as an add-on. This includes ensuring sustainability-related intended learning outcomes are incorporated.
*  **Basic Knowledge**: Provide a common base of knowledge across disciplines to ensure that all students have a foundational understanding of climate change and sustainability. This includes scientific literacy and understanding the interconnectedness of environmental, social, and economic systems.
*   **Systemic Understanding**: Promote the understanding of the systemic nature of ecological challenges, including their links with the economic, social, and political spheres.
*   **Critical Thinking:** Enable students to understand the construction of scientific facts, to analyze the political issues around climate change and to become aware of biased narratives.

### Pedagogical Approaches
*   **Six "Gates" Methodology**: Use the six "gates" approach (Oikos, Ethos, Nomos, Logos, Praxis, and Dunamis) to explore ecological and social transition issues from multiple angles. This methodology helps create a systemic vision of the challenges by identifying connections between different fields.
*   **Active and Experiential Learning:** Employ methods that go beyond traditional lectures and include real-world experiences, practical activities, and group projects.
*  **Mobilizing Head, Heart and Body:** Use diverse activities to engage students intellectually, emotionally, and physically, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the content. This might involve reflection exercises, encouraging exciting encounters, or creating safe spaces for talking.
*   **Collective Intelligence Tools**: Use collective intelligence tools to bring out the multiple facets of a problem.
*  **Simulation and Role Play:** Use simulations or role play to help students think and make ethical choices.
*   **Controversy Mapping**: Carry out investigations to represent the tensions, interactions between stakeholders, and scientific justifications.
*  **Assessment**: Encourage self-assessment, reflection, and the use of portfolios to show the students' progresses.

### Teacher Training and Support
*   **Training in ESD**: Provide teachers with training on sustainable development, SDGs, and related topics and challenges. This training should also help teachers develop an integrative view of sustainability by taking into account social, ecological, economic, and cultural dimensions.
*   **Pedagogical Skills:** Teachers must acquire innovative pedagogical skills to foster sustainability competencies in students. This includes skills in facilitation, collective intelligence, and transformative learning.
*   **Mentorship and Collaboration:** Establish mentoring programs and foster collaborations between teachers from different disciplines to promote the sharing of knowledge and experience.
*  **Resource Sharing**: Create platforms for sharing educational materials and best practices.

### Systemic Integration
*   **University-Wide Commitment**: Ensure a university-wide commitment to integrating sustainability, involving all actors, including students, faculty, and administrative staff.
*  **Strategic Planning:** Make sustainability a strategic focus in all studies and curriculum development.
* **Overcoming Barriers**: Address the barriers to integration, such as the compartmentalization of disciplines, lack of time, the grading system, and the pressures on teachers.

By incorporating these elements into a pedagogical framework, universities can effectively equip their students with the knowledge, skills, and values necessary to address climate change and contribute to a sustainable future. This should be seen as a long-term process that includes continuous improvements and collaboration between all stakeholders.
